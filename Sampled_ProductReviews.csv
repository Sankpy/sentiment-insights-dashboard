"Pick these up blindly if you get them below 2k
","Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. Have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.I use Audio Technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. Bought these JBL Bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.Pros:Charge lasts about 5 hours.Lightweight.Produces very clear sound.Bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.Cons:Slightly more expensive than I'd have liked, I paid 2250...Microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating. People keep telling me I sound like I'm far away.

","This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made â?¹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9 and also on an iPhone 7 and it was all the same.

","One of the worst in so far I've used. Disconnects automatically. To connect it back I've to off and on sometimes. Totally disappointed.base is just enough.

"Average earphones.
","Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

","This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ainâ??t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a â??In-Earâ? type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Batteryâ??s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u canâ??t expect Noise Isolation itâ??s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"Before you buy this please have a look at my review.
","First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

"Simply put - the best earphone in the price range!!
","I don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. Quite frankly I've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. If you want Xtreme bass then I would suggest you to go for Sony or JBL earphones. But this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.

"Best Value for Your Money
","Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.

"Nice product to listen music but not talk
","As a headphone to listen music its a very nice buy. But the major con of the product is its mouth piece. The mouth piece should have been more closer to the mouth. Everytime you try to speak to someone you have to hold the mouth piece closer. And there is no hook as well to clutch it on your cloth.Apart from this all is good.

"Middle of the road. Your mileage may vary.
","My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.

","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Great for the buck
","Based on usage so far I have very few complaints. The buttons that are programmed for volume, can't be programmed for media changer. And that there is no caller id in the earphones, but apart from these I love the product. Yes the sound quality or noise cancellation is not as great as airpods or high end earphones, which is obvious given the cost of the product. But for the price, the product is great.

"The Worst Earphones Ever
","First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones.

Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"Not working as expected
","Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me ""are you outside, we are getting so many noise""I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don't know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that's matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say ""Don't go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose""
